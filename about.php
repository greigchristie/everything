Everything is a database of all the tracks that I have purchased over the years.
</p>
<p>
This includes items bought on physical CD, as a digital download, or contained on a magazine cover disc.<br>
There is a lot of music in my collection and I started to find it impossible to remember what I own at a track level.<br>
<em>Still just about remembering at an album level (for now).</em>

The site is built in PHP using custom code I wrote myself. The look and feel comes courtesy of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and I use some icons from <a href="http://glyphicons.com/">Glyphicons</a> and <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>.<br>
I also make use of the <a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a> <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/">API</a> on  various pages.
